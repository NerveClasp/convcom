# convcom
[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) terminal helper utility

## Twitch
I'm planning to stream writing this on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/beardy_coding) at around 8pm [EET (GMT+2)](https://savvytime.com/converter/ukraine-kyiv-to-united-kingdom-london-ca-los-angeles-ny-new-york-city) which is 6pm GMT (London), 10am PST (Los Angeles), and 1pm EST (New York)

## Idea
Use this tool to write something like this:
```bash
convcom "My commit message here"
```
while being on a git branch like this:
```
feature/BC-123-some-name
```
and getting a git commit message like so:
```
"feat: my commit message here (BC-123)"
```
